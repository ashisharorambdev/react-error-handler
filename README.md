# Getting Started with react-error-handler

This component will help you handle errors easily even if it is on your Stage/Prod Environment.

## How to use

Just import or copy this component into your project and wrap the component inside your main file. (eg. index.js/index.ts)

## How it is handled

When an error is caught instead of breaking the page and showing a white screen, it will show a proper Error message which can be updated in the component itself and have a reload button to help the user re-direct back to the page where we want to.

## Plus point

Sometimes this happens when the user or client faces an error but can't explain or couldn't tell what he was trying to so it will also take a screenshot which you can to your database with the API you will integrate in your Error boundary component. Along with the screenshot, you can also send error details and error logs which will help us to identify the issue
